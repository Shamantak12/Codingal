# Screenshots Folder

Add your screenshot images here:

1. **main-interface.png** - Screenshot of the main app interface (empty input box)
2. **happy-example.png** - Screenshot showing happy output (e.g., "i enjoy making food" → 😀)
3. **neutral-example.png** - Screenshot showing neutral output (e.g., "i like dancing" → 😐)

You can also add a screenshot of Teacher Mode if you want!

**Note:** If you prefer to host images elsewhere (GitHub issues, Imgur, etc.), just update the image paths in the main README.md file.
